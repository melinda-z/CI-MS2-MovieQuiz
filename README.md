## **Users Experience (UX)**

### **Project Goals**

- The primary goal of this project is to set up a form of game or mind sport for the players that may become a brief assessment for the user to measure the knowledge in films.

- The secondary goal is to help the user get their thinking mind on. According to studies, brain games may help sharpen certain thinking skills that tend to wane with age, such as processing speed, planning skills, reaction time, decision making, and short-term memory.

### **Target Audience**

- Considering the format of the quiz for this project, as there won't be pictures displayed in the question, our target audience will be over 16 year old.

- In today's world, everything is international, and that includes the film industry, most of the popular movies are known by majority people of the wrold, considering that, our target audience's location is global.

- As there's no evidence shows that man loves watching moive more than woman or vice versa (even though I hear a lot from my female friends that their men watches the same movie over and over!), our target audience will be both genders.

- The best way to promote our quiz game is through online advertisements and social media shares.
